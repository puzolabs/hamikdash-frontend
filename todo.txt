
preparations:
in the server define an event for each KorbanOption
in the app, fill the event map from the server

missing screens:
history page

in the list:
when visit is done, remove from the visits list to history list

korban case page:
check each case is displayed as the json file

date finder page:
- time zone in the app should be displayed in jerusalem timezone (+3\+2 hours than the response from the server)
- if no connection - display alert
- browsing to next month should clean from ui all time slots until user press on a day

summery page:
use jerusalem time zone (must be tested for time diferences)

technical dept:
 - make sure to depend on device dimensions
 - dont use hard coded strings e.g. Cal.com's host name - use preferences for qa and prod. read the preferences from remote like Firebase offers
