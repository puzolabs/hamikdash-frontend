מה לעשות עם מצורע שצריך שני תורים אחד בלי קורבן ואחד עם

implement analytics

preparations:
in the server define an event for each KorbanOption
in the app, fill the event map from the server

files:
persist visits and read on app load
sync visits to remote storage so its available on other logged in devices

missing screens:
login page
about page with credits and app version and עילוי נשמות
history page

in the list:
when visit is done, remove from the visits list to history list

korban case page:
option card is very large - shorten it
check each case is displayed as the json file
if there are the same korban repeating like in mezora.json for minha and nasahim then display with * 3
להוסיף תיאור במקום כותרת ארוכה

date finder page:
time zone in the app should be displayed in jerusalem timezone (+3\+2 hours than the response from the server)
if no connection - display alert
test what happens in this scenario:
  - user A selected a time slot
  - user B selected the same time slot and confirms
  - user A confirms
  expected result is user A sees alert and controls are cleared to find another date
refactor such that each Option has an enum of Options so I can derive duration and event name and event id for getMonthAvailability\event-creation\rescheduling instead of hard coded 'minha'
getAvailability sometimes gets:
  FormatException (FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 16983)
  ...4-12-15T14:00:00.000Z"},{"time":2024-12-15T14:15:00.000Z"},{"time":"2024...
                                         ^

summery page:
display the selected option
put date label with locale (international)
use jerusalem time zone (must be tested for time diferences)

details page:
display the selected option
allow for canceling
allow updating the korban type

general:
 - location of 'next' button (right \ left) depends on the text direction

technical dept:
 - support more templating options for calcom widget: CalcomEmbedOptions: styles, dark \ light theme, success callbacks. but remove size since its always (100,100)
 - replace korbanot with korbans
 - make sure android and ios name doesn't contain the word 'example' in the result binary
 - make sure to depend on device dimensions
 - dont use hard coded strings e.g. Cal.com's host name - use preferences for qa and prod
