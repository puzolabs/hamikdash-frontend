
preparations:
in the server define an event for each KorbanOption
in the app, fill the event map from the server

missing screens:
history page

in the list:
when visit is done, remove from the visits list to history list

korban case page:
check each case is displayed as the json file

date finder page:
- time zone in the app should be displayed in jerusalem timezone (+3\+2 hours than the response from the server)
- if no connection - display alert
- test what happens in this scenario:
  - user A selected a time slot
  - user B selected the same time slot and confirms
  - user A confirms
  expected result is user A sees alert and controls are cleared to find another date
- refactor such that each Option has an enum of Options so I can derive duration and event name and event id for getMonthAvailability\event-creation\rescheduling instead of hard coded 'minha'
- add a test for get availability receiving:
{
  "result": {
    "data": {
      "json": {
        "slots": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
- getAvailability sometimes gets:
  FormatException (FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 16983)
  ...4-12-15T14:00:00.000Z"},{"time":2024-12-15T14:15:00.000Z"},{"time":"2024...
                                         ^

summery page:
use jerusalem time zone (must be tested for time diferences)

technical dept:
 - make sure to depend on device dimensions
 - dont use hard coded strings e.g. Cal.com's host name - use preferences for qa and prod. read the preferences from remote like Firebase offers
