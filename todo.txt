
preparations:
in the server define an event for each KorbanOption
in the app, fill the event map from the server

missing screens:
history page

in the list:
when visit is done, remove from the visits list to history list

korban case page:
check each case is displayed as the json file

date finder page:
- time zone in the app should be displayed in jerusalem timezone (+3\+2 hours than the response from the server)
- if no connection - display alert
- use enum of Options so I can derive duration and event name and event id for getMonthAvailability\event-creation\rescheduling instead of hard coded 'minha'
- browsing to next month should clean from ui all time slots until user press on a day
- bug: it always show 'no available times today' when entering calendar for the first time. maybe related to the fact that now() is not converted to jerusalem time zone?

deatils page:
display the time range (end time) of the visit

summery page:
use jerusalem time zone (must be tested for time diferences)
display the time range (end time) of the visit

technical dept:
 - make sure to depend on device dimensions
 - dont use hard coded strings e.g. Cal.com's host name - use preferences for qa and prod. read the preferences from remote like Firebase offers
