
preparations:
in the server define an event for each KorbanOption
in the app, fill the event map from the server

korban case page:
check each case is displayed as the json file

date finder page:
time zone in the app should be displayed in jerusalem timezone (+3\+2 hours than the response from the server)

summery page:
use jerusalem time zone (must be tested for time diferences)
dont insert to list only when user press  ishur - since what if he didnt press it and leave the page as it is?

details page:
text 'you can cancel here'. text 'canceling completed'.
prevent going back during cancelation.
ask are you sure? before canceling

technical dept:
 - make sure to depend on device dimensions
 - dont use hard coded strings e.g. Cal.com's host name - use preferences for qa and prod. read the preferences from remote like Firebase offers
