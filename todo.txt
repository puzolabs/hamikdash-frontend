in the server define an event for each KorbanOption
in the app, fill the event map from the server

when a visit is done, change the visit's status + remove from the visits list to history list

korban case page:
check each case is displayed as the json file

technical dept:
 - make sure to depend on device dimensions
 - dont use hard coded strings e.g. Cal.com's host name - use preferences for qa and prod. read the preferences from remote like Firebase offers
