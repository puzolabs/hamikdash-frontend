
preparations:
in the server define an event for each KorbanOption
in the app, fill the event map from the server

korban case page:
check each case is displayed as the json file

date finder page:
time zone in the app should be displayed in jerusalem timezone (+3\+2 hours than the response from the server)

summery page:
use jerusalem time zone (must be tested for time diferences)

technical dept:
 - dont use hard coded strings e.g. Cal.com's host name - use preferences for qa and prod. read the preferences from remote like Firebase offers

minimum pretify on tablet:
 - icons for 'nose' subject, minha and nesachim, bread and matza doesnt work
 - before the western wall i see the flutter icon. maybe only on debug?
 - new visit page: generate an image for each visit use-case
 - replace המשקדש שלי ב בית הבחירה
 - remove the house icon on start page
 - reorder the cases such that birth is before bekhor etc
 - consider hide the sadEvent collection and show it only by a setting key
