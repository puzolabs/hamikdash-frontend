מה לעשות עם מצורע שצריך שני תורים אחד בלי קורבן ואחד עם
support languages + location of 'next' button (right \ left) depends on the text direction
implement analytics

ger:
missing support for optionalKorbanotOptions

files:
sync visits to remote storage so its available on other logged in devices

new screens:
login page
about page with credits and app version and נחל ארנון טקס הביכורים and עילוי נשמות

korban case page:
option card is very large - shorten it
if there are the same korban repeating like in mezora.json for minha and nasahim then display with * 3
להוסיף תיאור במקום כותרת ארוכה

date selection page:
 - prevent browsing the calendar to previous month than the current date since user can't select any date
 - if the current month has no available dates then display the first month that has availability and prevent browsing to previous months
 - fix scrolling of slots i think should be to the entire page not only on that section. maybe Expand() should be upper in tree
 - calendar widget bug: the calender changed event is being called twice
 - calendar widget: disable ability to click on unsupported day
 - allow searching dates by hebrew calendar
 - flow for next version when payment is supported: user confirmed a date but didnt make it to the summery page. should we cancel ?
 - performance: in the beginning of 'create' method you can test if the requested time is before the current time. if so - don't invoke the call to Cal's server
    // assuming that dtStart is given in Jerusalem time zone
    void _validateStartTime(DateTime dtStart) {
      var now = tz.TZDateTime.now(app_globals.jerusalem!);
      var start = tz.TZDateTime.from(dtStart, app_globals.jerusalem!); // this is not conversion but rathar constructing the variable

      if(!now.isBefore(start)) { //'now' equals or after 'start'
        throw Exception('Time slot in the past');
      }
    }

coming options page:
 - have dedicate icons for each use case
 - add text that for "I bring all" - that you will need to "deposit" them 3 days earlier for בדיקת מומים.
    - only if its aminals.
    - what about birds?
    - maybe only for specific korban? if so - add to json files.

payment page:
 - have a 'pay' button that call the payment gateway
 - nicer "next" button

summery page:
 - display the selected option
 - put date label with locale (international)
 - use hebrew date also
 - consider using david star svg file for the confetti particle
 - consider the text הזמנת הביקור הושלמה בהצלחה
 - add info about selected payment

details page:
 display the selected option
 allow for canceling
 allow updating the korban type
 use hebrew date also
 add info about selected payment
 restrict editing the type:
 - only if he brings all - we can let him replace the korban type without affecting the payment. otherwise, he should pay the gap or be refunded
 - only if the old visit duration is higher or equals to the new visit's. otherwise, time overlap between 2 different visitors so user has to reschedule

canceling flow:
- in case he paid, ask if refund or donation ?
- call server:
  - to free the time slot
  - in case he paid and wants a refund - call payment gateway for a refund
- message "we are processing your request, we will send you an email to {email address}"

add a page for טקס הביכורים
awesome_notifications
event map should be a json config file instead of hard coded dart file
add isha sota case with section sadEvent

technical debt:
 - replace korbanot with korbans
