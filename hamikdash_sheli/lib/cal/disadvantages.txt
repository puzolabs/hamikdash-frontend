1. can't position the UI in reschedule state
2. can't skip redundant confirmation page
3. skipping summery page is cumbersome - can mitigate this by setting a Booking success URL redirection to an empty HTML page
4. don't have a way to cancel a meeting
5. can't remove header with details about the meeting - can mitigate this with css to hide this section?
6. localization to hebrew of 'confirm' button and cal.com's summery page seems cumbersome if at all possible
7. bug: when entering name and email and the keyboard is shown - a yellow strip is shown on UI
8. bug: time zone in the app is displayed in + 3 hours in the server. in the app it say UTC and I cant change (maybe its a setting in the server)

todo:
1. support more templating options for calcom widget: CalcomEmbedOptions: styles, dark \ light theme, success callbacks. but remove size since its always (100,100)

date finder page:
 - avoid the screen that ask the user to fill fields of its name and email - its redundant for him
 - allow searching dates by hebrew calendar
 - when released in cal.com next version: support rescheduleBookingSuccessful and bookingCanceled in the template
 - flow for next version when payment is supported: user confirmed a date but didnt make it to the summery page. should we cancel ?
