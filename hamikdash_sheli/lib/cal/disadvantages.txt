1. can't position the UI in reschedule state
2. can't skip redundant confirmation page
3. skipping summery page is cumbersome - can mitigate this by setting a Booking success URL redirection to an empty HTML page
4. don't have a way to cancel a meeting
5. can't remove header with details about the meeting - can mitigate this with css to hide this section?
6. localization to hebrew of 'confirm' button and cal.com's summery page seems cumbersome if at all possible
7. bug: when entering name and email and the keyboard is shown - a yellow strip is shown on UI
